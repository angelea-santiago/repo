- `Art or volleyball`
- ` For art I've done it right about forever and I started playing volleyball for fun with my friends in the 7th grade. `
- `On art, the artistic spark comes when it comes. For volleyball, I play on the weekends sometimes and I always play in gym.`
- `With art it's just fun to make things. For volleyball it's fun to learn and play with others.`
